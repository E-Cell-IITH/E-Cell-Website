Today, a captivating opportunity unfolded as our school hosted a section on the E-Cell at IIT Hyderabad. The essence of this event lies in the prospect of participating in the first level, with the promise of advancing to Madras and encountering esteemed IIT professionals, including higher-ranking individuals.  The significance of this initiative was underscored by the testimonial of Somya Sahoo, a recent participant in the E-Cell program. His endorsement resonated with the idea that this experience not only offers a platform for intellectual growth but also opens doors to engage with the higher echelons of the IIT community.  During the event, I had the privilege of learning from two dynamic individuals, Khairnar and Katte, who served as the main explainers. Their insights and guidance provided invaluable perspectives on the multifaceted world of entrepreneurship and innovation. As they delved into the intricacies of the E-Cell program, it became evident that this initiative is not just about competition; it is a journey of exploration, collaboration, and knowledge dissemination.  As I reflect on Somya's journey and the enlightening session led by Khairnar and Katte, it becomes apparent that participating in the E-Cell program is not merely an academic pursuit but a transformative experience. Their enthusiasm and expertise added depth to the event, further fueling my eagerness to explore this unique opportunity for personal and academic development.  In essence, the E-Cell at IIT Hyderabad represents a conduit to a world beyond textbooks, where innovation and entrepreneurship converge. The chance to interact with higher authorities from IIT Madras, coupled with the guidance of Khairnar and Katte, adds an extra layer of significance to this endeavor, promising exposure to the pinnacle of technological and academic excellence.

This initiative aligns with my aspirations for growth, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to and learning from the dynamic world of entrepreneurship and innovation.

The service providers, such as freelancers and other technical experts, get a chance to engage with seekers online. The cost of third-party outsourcing is mitigated and a direct solution is achieved. This allows seekers to improve IT budget allocation and service providers can receive better margins. Even before the pandemic, our economy was moving towards a more-flexible and freelance work culture. The COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated this shift. GeekOnDemand aims at supporting this shift. This means that IT or technical support freelancers who are willing to receive jobs at reasonable compensation will obtain maximum benefit here. We are aiming to register more than 1000 geeks in just one year of the launch. In the following year, we expect to reach a mark of 2,000. Our work model, efficient execution, and dedicated services are expected to reveal exceptional results in the coming years."
